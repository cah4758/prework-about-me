      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a teacher looking to break into the world of coding! Currently I work as a Band Director in Dallas, TX and I hope that I can someday help develop tools for future students to read music and perform.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Originally from Corpus Christi, TX, I moved up to Dallas after accepting a job with Dallas ISD. I have just completed my <strong>7th year</strong> of teaching in total.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I have recently started refreshing my love for golf because I had so much time to kill with the long Spring Break due to covid. All in all, I have played golf for at least 16 years. Another hobby I have very recently picked up is Bouldering, which gives me a great excuse to work on my upper body strength!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be with a company similar to MakeMusic, which created SmartMusic (student music reading practice tool) and Finale (music composition tool).</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>For now, I am living in Dallas, TX enjoying all of the barbecue and Whataburger that my body allows.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>For the past 15 months, I have seen education start leaning towards more remote/web-based tools. I would like to help in creating tools that help music students continue learning and create opportunities for their future.</p>
